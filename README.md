# Tokenizer
A .NET Core console app to generate a JWT token based on input values.

## Keep in mind
The original tutorial from where I got the main understanding of the JWT generation using C# came from [here](https://medium.com/@mmoshikoo/jwt-authentication-using-c-54e0c71f21b0)
It's a very good tutorial for you to get started with a small example of how a token is generated. 

I might try a different C# library in the future and it might be in the same project or another.
